  /**
   * Creates a new secret. A secret in AWS Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of "versions" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more "staging labels" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The SecretVersionsToStages field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and are not included in the list. You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in the SecretString parameter or binary data in the SecretBinary parameter. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and, if you don't supply a staging label, automatically maps the new version's ID to the staging label AWSCURRENT.    If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the SecretString and SecretBinary for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a KMS encryption key, AWS Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then AWS Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an AWS Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.   If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the KMSKeyId. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt SecretString or SecretBinary using credentials from a different account then the KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role.

For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see Rotating Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states:   The AWSPENDING and AWSCURRENT staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or   The AWSPENDING staging label is not attached to any version of the secret.   If instead the AWSPENDING staging label is present but is not attached to the same version as AWSCURRENT then any later invocation of RotateSecret assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:RotateSecret   lambda:InvokeFunction (on the function specified in the secret's metadata)    Related operations    To list the secrets in your account, use ListSecrets.   To get the details for a version of a secret, use DescribeSecret.   To create a new version of a secret, use CreateSecret.   To attach staging labels to or remove staging labels from a version of a secret, use UpdateSecretVersionStage.

To encrypt and store binary data as part of the version of a secret, you must use either the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.    If this update creates the first version of the secret or if you did not include the VersionStages parameter then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to the new version and removes it from any version that had it previously.
