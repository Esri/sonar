# Sonar

<img align="right" src="./images/sonar_108.png" alt="sonar logo">Information should be easily accessible and ubiquitous. Often data requires complex user experiences through limited devices. Instead, what if data can be conversational through commonly used communications tools like Facebook Messenger and Amazon Alexa voice recognition.

Sonar bot provides a natural language interface to local government open data and demographic services that helps people ask questions of their community.

This project is a prototype concept that is still evolving. It currently supports:

- Facebook messenger
- Slack
- Alexa Echo Skills

## Develop

Sonar is built with [ClaudiaJS](https://claudiajs.com/) and hosted on Amazon Web Services.

To start developing, you will need to use an Amazon developer account.

### Quick Start

First run trhough the [Installing and Configuring Claudia.js](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/installing.html) documentation, specifically the parts about installing Claudia globally (`npm install claudia -g`) and [Configuring Access Credentials](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/installing.html#configuring-access-credentials). Then:

1. Clone this repo
1. `npm install`
1. Update your preferred AWS region in `package.json` and `claudia.json`
1. Create (first time): `npm run create`
1. Creating will deploy the appropriate API endpoints and lambda functions, but you must also then [configure](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/hello-world-chatbot.html#connecting-with-facebook-messenger) the platforms you want. For example, 
    1. For Alexa: `claudia update --configure-alexa-skill`
    1. For Slack: `claudia update --configure-slack-slash-command`
    1. [etc](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/hello-world-chatbot.html#connecting-with-facebook-messenger)
1. Updates: `npm run update` - will re-deploy your code to AWS.

### ArcGIS Token

To use the geoenrichment services for population, you will need to add an ArcGIS Token to the [Amazon API Gateway Stage Variables](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console.html)

1. Visit Amazon API Gateway
1. Within your API, click on "Stages"
1. Click on "latest"
1. Click on tab "Stage Variables"
1. Click on "Add Stage Variable"
1. In Name text input, enter `arcgisToken` and in Value text input enter your token
1. Click on the gray checkmark to the far right side



### Update Amazon Lambda functions

`npm run create`

_or_ `claudia create --region us-east-1 --api-module bot`

`npm run update`

_or_ `claudia update`

### Get Logs


Requires [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).

`npm run logs`

_or_ `aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/claudia-test`
